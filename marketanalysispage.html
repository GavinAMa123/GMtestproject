	<h1>Market Analysis</h1>
	<p>The Elite team calculated this in order to see approximately how many people would buy our product. They first estimated how many people would buy our product in each age group. One age group is a span of ten years. We then added all of our estimations together to find about how many people in the U.S. would buy the Elite. This information was used in our Financial page, and was also used to calculate other aspects of the Elite, like the pricing.</p><br/>
